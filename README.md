# Abstract

One kind of investment that has become very popular among tech savvy investors in recent times is ICO investing. ICO or Initial Coin Offering is a fund raising mechanism used by blockchain projects in which the project teams  sell their underlying crypto tokens in exchange for bitcoin and ether. Itâ€™s somewhat similar to an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in which investors purchase shares of a company.

ICOs provide funding to a startup team to develop and launch their project while also incentivizing the community to invest. If the project succeeds and the tokens increase in value, the investor can sell them and make a profit.

Because the ICOs happen on blockchains, they benefit from the advantages of a decentralized ledger. In other words, ICOs are decentralized with no single point of failure and no central entities controlling them.
 
ICOs typically have multiple rounds of fund raising that involve selling crypto tokens. The earlier an investor can acquire the tokens the better return on investment he or she can hope to have. In some cases, depending on the token metrics a higher ROI may be virtually guaranteed (eg: early investors receiving bonus tokens resulting in a significantly lower cost-basis). Hence to improve the odds of an increased ROI the key for savvy investors is to get in early on in the fund raising rounds. However individual investors are faced with challenges participating in the early rounds of fund raising.
 
 1. Very high 'minimum contribution' requriements.
 2. Requirement for accredition for US based investors.
 
Right off the bat, the above two requirements  eliminate a significant segment of individual investors from taking part in the early rounds of ICO (aka presales). This limits the participation to only a very small percentage of (high-net worth) investors. 

The incentive to participate in presales is very high and in absence of any convenient option, several 'underground' online groups and forums have cropped up where members pool the money in to meet the minimum contribution requirement. The pooled contribution is then sent to the ICO team by a member representative who is either the creator of the pool or an accredited investor or has negotiated a deal with the ICO team or all of the above. After the ICO team receives the ETH, the corresponding number of tokens are sent to this member, who then has the responsibility of distributing the tokens proportionally among the pool contributors. It is customary for an 'honest' pool representative to collect fees for his 'brokerage' services.

Besides the (sometimes exorbitant) fee that is charged by the pool representative, there is a serious issue with this type of investing model. The issue is that of 'trust'. The pool contributors have to trust the anonymous representative to collect the funds on their behalf, broker the deal with the ICO teams and then to distribute the tokens proportional to their investment. This may not be an issue if the minimum contribution for the presale is small, which can be fulfiled by a small group whose members know and trust each other. However, the majority of big projects that seek to raise funds have a significantly large amount as the minimum required contribution for presales. This necessitates the group to comprise of a large number of members with small individual contributions.
