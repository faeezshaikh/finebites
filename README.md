# Abstract

One kind of investment that has become very popular among tech savvy investors in recent times is the ICO investing. ICO or Initial Coin Offering is a fund raising mechanism used by blockchain projects in which the project teams  sell their underlying crypto tokens in exchange for bitcoin and ether. Itâ€™s somewhat similar to an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in which investors purchase shares of a company.(https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-ico/).

ICOs provide funding to a startup team to develop and launch their project while also incentivizing the community to invest. If the project succeeds and the tokens increase in value, the investor can sell them and make a profit.

Because the ICOs happen on blockchains, they benefit from the advantages of a decentralized ledger. In other words, ICOs are decentralized with no single point of failure and no middle man controlling them.
 
ICOs typically have multiple rounds of fund raising in that involve selling tokens. The earlier an investor can acquire the tokens the better return on investment he or she can hope to have. In some cases, depending on the token metrics a higher ROI may be virtually guaranteed (early investors receiving bonus tokens resulting in a significantly lower cost-basis). Hence to improve the odds of an increased ROI the key for savvy investors is to get in early on, in the fund raising rounds. However individual investors are faced with challenges participating in the earlly rounds of fund raising.
 
 1. Very high minimum contribution requriements.
 2. Requirement for accredition for US based investors.
 
Right off the bat, the above two requirements  eliminate a significant segment of individual investors from taking part in the early rounds of ICO (aka presales). This limits the participation to only a very small percentage of (high-net worth) investors
