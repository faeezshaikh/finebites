# Abstract

One kind of investment that has become very popular among tech savvy investors in recent times is the ICO investing. ICO or Initial coin offering is a fund raising mechanism used by blockchain projects in which the project teams  sell their underlying crypto tokens in exchange for bitcoin and ether. Itâ€™s somewhat similar to an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in which investors purchase shares of a company.(https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-ico/).

ICOs provide funding to the startup team to develop and launch their project while also incentivizing the community to invest. If the project succeeds and the tokens increase in value, the investor can sell them and make a profit.

Because the ICOs happen on blockchains, they benefit from the advantages of a decentralized ledger. In other words, ICOs are decentralized with no single point of failure or middle man controlling them.
 
ICOs have multiple rounds of fund raising (by selling tokens). The earlier an investor can acquire the tokens the better return on investment she can hope to have. In some cases, depending on the token metrics a higher ROI may be virtually guaranteed (guranteed bonus tokens resulting in a lower cost basis). Hence the key for savvy investors is to get in early on, in the fund raising rounds. However individual investors are faced with challenges participating in the earlly rounds of funding. 
 
 1. Very high minimum contribution requriements.
 2. Requirement for accredition for US based investors.
 
Right off the bat, the above two requirements  eliminate a significant segment of individual investors from taking part in the early rounds of ICO aka presales. This limits the participation Only a very small percentage of (high-net worth) investors
